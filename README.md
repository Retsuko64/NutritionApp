# NutritionApp

This is my first project on C++, i am still very new to this, so the project here is very basic and simple.
Its a text-based user interface on terminal.

This project is meant for nutritionists, where they could organize their users, set up their diet, and the user could state what they had during their day and the
nutritionist would be able to see that. The nutritionist would also be able to contact their users in a chat, and talk about their diet and habit of eating etc..
literally anything that would happen when you go to a nutritionist in an app.

So far the features in this app, is that user can ask for BMI (Body Mass Index) ,check their diet , and state what they had during their day.
while the nutritionist could set up a diet for a specific user and see what they had during their day.

This app is yet not server-based but i'd like to do so in the future.

Note: I understand that storing users in a text file is weird but i still am not familiar with the idea of database, hopefully i'd make this app more and more better.
